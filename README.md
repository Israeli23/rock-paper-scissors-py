# rock-paper-scissors-py
A Simple Rock, Paper or Scissors game made using python

This is my first project using python. 

This project allowed me to illustrate my understanding of key python concepts. For example, using if statements to determine the winner based on the rules of Rock, paper, Scissors. Also using user input to select different variations and random module for the computers choice.
